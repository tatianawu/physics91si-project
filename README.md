# Physics 91SI Project

Final project for Stanford's Physics 91SI course in spring 2018.

* Visualizes a game of Assassins played by my freshman dorm.
* Uses NetworkX to represent the network.

(Unfortunately, NetworkX doesn't have animation functionality for its graphs so the visualization isn't great. This was also my first project of any sort using Python, so it's definitely not pretty.)
