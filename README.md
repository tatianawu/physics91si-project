# Physics 91SI Project

Final project for Stanford's Physics 91SI course in spring 2018.

* Visualizes a game of Assassin's played by my freshman dorm.
* Uses NetworkX to represent the network.

(Unfortunately, NetworkX doesn't have animation functionality for its graphs. Additionally, the network analysis is poorly implemented and very inefficient.)
